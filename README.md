# VarEmbed in Blocks
This is the implementation for the following paper, to appear at EMNLP 2016:
Morphological Priors for Probabilistic Neural Word Embeddings.  Parminder Bhatia, Robert Guthrie, Jacob Eisenstein.

Using LSTM's for word embeddings that incorporate word-level and morpheme-level information using Blocks and Fuel.
LSTM code modified from https://github.com/johnarevalo/blocks-char-rnn.git.

## Requirements

* Install Blocks. Please see the
[documentation](http://blocks.readthedocs.org/) for more information.

* Install Fuel.  Please see the
[documentation](http://fuel.readthedocs.org/) for more information.

* Install the Morfessor Python package.

## Usage

The input can be any raw, pre-tokenized text.  This will walk through how to generate the Morfessor model, preprocess and package the data as NDArrays, and train the model.

You will need to train a Morfessor model on your data.  A script for this has been provided.  It will output a serialized Morfessor model for later use.

```python train_morfessor.py --training-data <input.txt> --output <output.bin>```

The data set needs to be preprocessed and formatted, using preprocess_data.py and make_dataset.py.
The -h flag will give the arguments needed.
Preprocessing is downcasing so that capitalization doesn't affect Morfessor.

```python preprocess_data.py <textfile>.trn -o <output_file> -n <unks all but top N words>```

```python make_dataset.py <textfile>.trn -mf <morfessor_model.bin>```

Next, run train.py to train the model.
It will print statistics after each mini-batch.

```python train.py <filename>.hdf5```

Parameters like batch size, embedding dimension, and the number of epochs can be changed in the config.py file.

**CAUTION** Be sure to set change `max_morphemes_per_word` in `config.py` to whatever Morhphessor outputted (e.g. `Word with most morphemes has 19 morphemes`).

Last, word vectors can be output in the format word dim1 dim2 ..., with 1 word per line, via the output_word_vectors.py script.
Provide it a vocab of vectors to output, as well as a serialized network from training.
